// Assume you were hired to create an application for an ISP, and there is n number of network devices,

// a 2D array that represents network connections between these network devices such that a[i]=[xi,yi] where
// xi is connected to yi device.
// Suppose there is a power outage on a certain device provided as int n represents
// id of the device on which power failure occurred)), Write an algorithm to return impacted network devices due
// to breakage of the link between network devices. These impacted device list assists you notify linked consumers
// that there is a power outage and it will take some time to rectify an issue. Note that: node 0 will always
